# Backend Railway Configuration
# IMPORTANT: In Railway dashboard, set Root Directory to "back-end"
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"

# Alternative: Use docker-compose.yml for all services
# builder = "DOCKERFILE"
# dockerfilePath = "docker-compose.yml"

[deploy]
startCommand = "./main"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

# Note: For Railway, you can use docker-compose.yml by:
# 1. Setting Root Directory to "back-end"
# 2. Railway will automatically detect docker-compose.yml
# 3. All services (postgres, mongodb, redis, backend) will be deployed
